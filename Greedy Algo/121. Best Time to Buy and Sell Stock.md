#### [121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

**Description**

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0



**Example**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

```

**Solution**

贪心算法：

维护最小的买入价和最大的利润，遍历一次数组进行更新：当天的价格是否最低？当天如果买入，减去最低价格后是否利润最大？

**Code**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int minPrice = INT_MAX;//不是取0；min取最大，max取最小
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++){
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minPrice);
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```
